Feedback is always appreciated, as I have spent DAYS at a time improving this tool for all to learn and use in their trading.")
Title2 = input(true, title="This indicator has been designed to work on the majority, if not all, tickers provided by TradingView. It was designed on BTCUSD but has been tested on traditional equities, FOREX, indicies and more. It was designed using the hourly, 4h, 6h, and 1D timeframes but is ideally good on all of them. Expect the lower frames to be less consistent (for all you 1 minute traders). Updates will continue to be provided and Ive been promising a blog on this in the near future. Stay tuned.")
Title3 = input(true, title="v 5.1 is one of the best and most accurate yet. I believe I have fixed the ghost alert issue entirely, and have also added for the buy/sells to only paint once the candle has closed. This shold eliminate issues on several fronts, but I will continue to fight bugs as the come about")
